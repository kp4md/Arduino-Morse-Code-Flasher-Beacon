# Arduino-Morse-Code-Flasher-Beacon
This Arduino Nano Sketch flashes a bright LED light and 90 dB buzzer with a repeating message in Morse Code.  It includes punctuation and ITU prosigns.
It is originally designed to flash a 100 lumen Harbor Freight 24 LED Superbright Worklight/Flashlight which is visible over 1 km at night and can simultaneously sound a 90 dB 2500 Hz buzzer.
